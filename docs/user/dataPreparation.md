## Image sequence

FastTrack is able to open image sequences if they follow the standard leading 0 naming convention (name000.xyz, name001.xyz, name002.xyz, etc...). *.bmp, *.dib, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.jpe, *.jp2, *.png, *.pbm, *.pgm, *.ppm, *.sr, *.ras, *.tiff, *.tif formats are supported. To open an image sequence, select any image of the sequence to load the whole sequence.

## Video

FastTrack can open video files, and a lot of [codecs](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-codecs.html) are supported. To open a video file, select the file.
