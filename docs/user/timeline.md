FastTrack provides a convenient tool called the timeline, which allows users to navigate easily within a video or image sequence.

To use the timeline, hover the mouse cursor over it to move across the video. Right-clicking will place the cursor at a specific position, which will be saved when the cursor exits the timeline.

To place a marker, double left-click on the desired location. To remove a marker, right-click on it.

There are also keyboard shortcuts available to move the cursor frame by frame:

* D: move to the next frame.
* Q: move to the previous frame (AZERTY layout).
* A: move to the previous frame (QWERTY layout).
* Space: start/stop autoplay.

These features make it easy and efficient to interact with the video or image sequence in FastTrack.
