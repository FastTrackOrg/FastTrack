### I have very different movies to track 
In this case, the best way to use FastTrack is the **Interactive** panel. You can easily find the right set of parameters for each movie with the help of the interactive environment.


### I have a large number of similar movies
In this case, it is best to use the **Interactive** panel in conjunction with the **Batch** panel. First, find the right set of parameters for a typical movie with the interactive tool. Then you can track the rest of the movies using the batch tool with this set of parameters.
