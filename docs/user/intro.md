Welcome to the FastTrack user manual. This manual will present the tracking software and how to use it. Please contact by email at **benjamin.gallois@fasttrack.sh** or chat on [irc](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fasttrackorg) if you need more information or to signal a bug. Subscribe to the [mailinglist](https://www.freelists.org/list/fasttrack) to get the FastTrack dev team's last updates.

FastTrack is a cross-platform application designed to track multiple objects in video recording. Stable versions of the software are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. The source code can be downloaded at https://github.com/FastTrackOrg/FastTrack.

Two main features are implemented in the software:

-  An automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects, conserving the objects' identities across the video recording.
-  An ergonomic tool allowing the user to check, correct and annotate the tracking.

The FastTrack user interface is implemented with Qt, the image analysis with the OpenCV library. This allows a performant and responsive software amenable to process large video recording.

FastTrack was first a Ph.D. thesis side project started by [Benjamin Gallois](https://github.com/bgallois) in his spare time that has then taken dedicated time in his Ph.D. project. The software's core is still maintained in his spare time; therefore, new features implementation, bug fixes, and help can take some time.

**Not sure if you want to use FastTrack? Check these five most common questions:**

**What video quality is required?**
FastTrack is designed to work with any video quality and frame rate.

**What type of objects and numbers can FastTrack handled?**

**How it performs?**
Tracking performances depend on systems (number and type of objects). However, with the built-in ergonomic tool, it is possible to achieve 100% tracking accuracy with minimal effort.

**It is free?**
FastTrack is a [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) software under the [GPL3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

**Do I need programming skills?**
No.
