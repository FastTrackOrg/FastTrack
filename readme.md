## About

Tracking objects in video recording can be tedious. Existing software are expensive, the learning curve can be steep, necessitate a powerful computer, and the workflow can not be easily adapted when the project evolved.

**FastTrack** is a free (as freedom) desktop tracking software, easy to install, easy to use, and performant. The software can be downloaded for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and a public API is available to embed the core of the software in any C++/Qt project.

Two main features are implemented in the software:
* An automatic tracking algorithm that can detect and track objects (conserving the objects' identities across the video recording).
* A manual review of the tracking where errors can be corrected rapidly and easily to achieve 100% accuracy.

## Installation

Stable builds of the software are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the [download page](https://www.fasttrack.sh/docs/installation/). Nightly builds are available on the [Github Actions artifacts](https://github.com/FastTrackOrg/FastTrack/actions).

## Documentation

User documentation can be found [here](http://www.fasttrack.sh/UserManual/docs/intro.html) with video tutorials, examples, and an extended description of the software.
Developer documentation can be found [here](http://www.fasttrack.sh/API/index.html). It contains information to set up a development environment and the API of FastTrack.
