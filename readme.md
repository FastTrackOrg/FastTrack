FastTrack, an open source project designed for efficient object tracking in videos, greatly benefits from the financial support provided by [Analyzable](https://github.com/Analyzable-FR). With a monthly contribution covering one day of development, Analyzable supports bug-solving and version releases, ensuring the project's maintenance and stability. However, for the continuous enhancement and addition of new features to FastTrack, we rely on additional donations. Your contributions are crucial for the ongoing evolution of FastTrack, making it an even more valuable tool for the community. We appreciate your support and encourage you to consider contributing to help us achieve our goals.

## About

Tracking objects in video recordings can be a tedious task, and existing software often comes with drawbacks like high cost, steep learning curves, hardware requirements, and inflexible workflows as the project evolves.

**FastTrack** is a free and open-source desktop tracking software that aims to address these issues. It offers ease of installation, user-friendly interface, and high performance. The software is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Additionally, a public API is available, allowing users to embed the core tracking functionality into any C++/Qt project.

FastTrack offers two main features:
1. Automatic tracking algorithm: This algorithm can efficiently detect and track objects while preserving their identities throughout the entire video recording.
2. Manual review of tracking: Users have the option to review and correct tracking errors swiftly, ensuring 100% accuracy.
